# COVID_19

The purpose of this work is based on Machine Learning tasks and deployment of a chain of
continuous processes to the monitoring, understanding and prediction of infection cases, nevertheless, the general objective of this work could be breaking down into 3 major ideas.
1) Apply clustering to the time series of infection rates for each country to determine whether
or not there are groups of similar countries that can be identified.
2) Compare time series of policy factors against the clusters identified from point 1 to determine what factors appear to have the most impact on infection rates. 
3) Apply LSTM techniques to estimating infection rates for COVID-19, and these the effectiveness of such models.
